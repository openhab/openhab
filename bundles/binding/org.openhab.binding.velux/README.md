# Velux Binding

This binding integrates the <B>Velux</B> devices with help of a gateway, the <B>Velux Bridge KLF200</B>.
The Velux Binding interacts via the Velux Bridge with any [io-homecontrol](http://www.io-homecontrol.com/)-based
devices like window openers, shutters and others.

Based on the VELUX API this binding integrates <B>Velux</B> and other io-homecontrol devices directly into the openHAB, avoiding the necessity of any cloud-based mediation infrastructures. The complete home-automation will work even without any Internet connectivity.

For details about the features, see the following websites:
- [Velux](http://www.velux.com)
- [Velux API](http://www.velux.com/api/klf200)

## Overview

As the API is widely open, there are several use cases which are supported by the Bridge:
From the complete configuration of a set of io-homecontrol devices including registration, naming, grouping, crypto key setup and exchange, the definition of intended settings, so called scenes, up to the control of single devices, i.e. ```open window of bathroom up to 45%```.

The following areas are covered:

## Binding Configuration

The binding can be configured by parameters in the global configuration file `openhab.cfg`.

| Property       | Default                | Required | Description                                               |
|----------------|------------------------|:--------:|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| bridgeIPAddress|                        |   Yes    | Hostname or address for accessing the Velux Bridge.       |
| bridgeProtocol | slip                   |    No    | Underlying communication protocol (http/https/slip).      |
| bridgeTCPPort  | 80                     |    No    | TCP port (80 or 51200)for accessing the Velux Bridge.     |
| bridgePassword | velux123               |    No    | Password for authentication against the Velux Bridge.(**) |
| timeoutMsecs   | 2000                   |    No    | Initial Connection timeout in milliseconds                |
| retries        | 6                      |    No    | Number of retries during I/O                              |

(**) Note: This password is the API password that is printed on the back of the unit. Normally it differs from the password of the web frontend.

Advise: if you see a significant number of messages per day like

```
 communicate(): socket I/O failed continuously (x times).
```

please increase the parameters retries or/and timeoutMsecs.

For your convenience you'll see a log entry for the recognized configuration within the log file i.e.

```

```


## Discovery

Unfortunately there is no way to discover the Velux bridge within the local network. Be aware that all Velux scenes have to be added to the local Velux Bridge configuration as described in the Velux setup procedure.

## Item Configuration

The Items of a Velux Bridge consists in general of a pair of mastertype and subtype definition.
In the appropriate items file, i.e. velux.items, this looks like

```
{ velux="thing=<Mastertype>;channel=<Subtype>" }
```

Optionally the subtype is enhanced with parameters like the appropriate name of the scene.

```
{ velux="thing=<Mastertype>;channel=<Subtype>#<Parameter>" }
```

| Mastertype | Description                                                               |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| bridge     | The Velux KLF200 represents a gateway to all Velux devices.               |
| scene      | Named ordered set of product states which can be activated for execution. |
| actuator   | IO-home controlled device which can be maintained by parameter settings.  |

| serial       | Switch        | IO-Homecontrol'ed device        				 | actuator   | required  |

Note (\*\*\*): The existence of this item triggers the continuous realtime status updates of any Velux item like shutters even if they are manually controlled by other controllers.


### Subtype Parameters

In case of the scene-related subtypes, action and silentMode, the spezification of the related scene as parameters is necessary;
```
{ velux="thing=scene;channel=<Subtype>#<Parameter>" }
```

The subtype shutter requires an even pair of parameters, each defining the shutter level and the related scene:
```
{ velux="thing=brigde;channel=shutter#<Level1>,<Scene1>,<Level2>,<Scene2>" }
```

### Virtual shutter

As the bridge does not support a real rollershutter interaction, this binding provides a virtual rollershutter consisting of different scenes which set a specific shutter level. Therefore the item definition contains multiple pairs of rollershutter levels each followed by a scene name, which leads to this setting.

### Debugging

For those who are interested in more detailed insight of the processing of this binding, a deeper look can be achieved by increased loglevel.

During startup of normal operations, there should be only some few messages within the logfile, like:
```

## Supported/Tested Firmware Revisions

The Velux Bridge in API version one (firmware version 0.1.1.*) allows activating a set of predefined actions, so called scenes. Therefore beside the bridge, only one main thing exists, the scene element. The next-generation firmware version two is not backward compatible, and does not provide a public web frontend, but version two does provide full access to any IO-Home compatible devices not limited to Velux and includes many different features.

| Firmware revision | Release date | Description                                                             |

| 0.1.1.0.42.0      | 2017-07-01   | Public Web Frontend w/ JSON-API.                                        |
| 0.1.1.0.44.0      | 2017-12-14   | Public Web Frontend w/ JSON-API.                                        |
| 2.0.0.71	    | 2018-09-27   | Public SLIP-API w/ private-only WLAN-based Web Frontend w/ JSON-API.    |

Notes:
- Velux bridges cannot be returned to version one of the firmware after being upgraded to version two.
- Firmware updates are currently provided at [Velux download area](https://updates2.velux.com/).


## Unknown Velux devices

All known <B>Velux</B> devices can be handled by this binding. However, there might be some new ones which will be reported within the logfiles.Therefore, error messages like the one below should be reported to the maintainers so that the new Velux device type can be incorporated."

```
[ERROR] [g.velux.things.VeluxProductReference] - PLEASE REPORT THIS TO MAINTAINER: VeluxProductReference(3) has found an unregistered ProductTypeId.
