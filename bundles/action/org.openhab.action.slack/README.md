# Slack Action
The Slack action sends messages to a Slack ([https://slack.com/]) channel or Slack user from a rule or script.

## Prerequisites
As described on the Slack page ([https://my.slack.com/services/new/bot]) you first need to create a bot.
After that you can use the authToken in the openHAB configuration (see below)

## Install
One way of installing would be to simply copy the org.openhab.action.slack*.jar to the OpenHAB addons folder
(e.g. for OpenHAB2 this would be /usr/share/openhab2/addons)

## Configuration 
The action can be configured in `services/slack.cfg`.

### Configuration example

```
authToken = your-bot-token-here
```


## Examples

### Send a text message to a Slack channel

slack.rules
```
rule "Send text message to Slack channel 'general'"
when
    Item Foo changed
then
    sendToSlackChannel("Item Foo changed", "general")
end    
```


### Send a text message to a Slack user

slack.rules
```
rule "Send text message to Slack user 'userxyz'"
when
    Item Foo changed
then
     sendToSlackUser ("Item Foo changed", "userxyz")
end    
```
