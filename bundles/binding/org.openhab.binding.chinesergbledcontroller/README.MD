Since I've purchased a wi-fi RGB controller from China, I've asked the guys to provide me SDK.
After they provided it appears to be an easy to develop a binding because the controller requires only 
TCP packets with specific bytes as a payload and based on the prefix/sufix and payload it reacts.
Binding is very simple and has been tested with RGB UI control and regular switch (ON/OFF).
Because there is no model or any other way to label it it's currently named chinesergbledcontroller. :)
