 * The reset preferences function sets all of the user configurable settings back to the factory default values. This
 * function call will not only reset the top level thermostat settings such as hvacMode, lastServiceDate and vent, but
 * also all of the user configurable fields of the thermostat.settings and thermostat.program objects.
 *
 * Note that this does not reset all values. For example, the installer settings and wifi details remain untouched.
